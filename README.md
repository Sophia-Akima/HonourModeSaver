# HonourModeSaver
Allows you to save scum honour mode in Baldurs Gate 3 using a simple batch script.

All you have to do is edit it in notepad, put in the path to your save location and WinRAR or 7zip installation, and run the script.

It requires a bit of forethought, a good practice would be to backup your save every time you save in-game, this way if something happens you wish to reverse, you can exit to the menu, then restore the save file to the backup. This can certainly be made better but I'm not a programmer.

Here are two minute long example videos below
